I have been called a hipster because I always use the terminal.

I feel super powerfull when I'm typing in commands and non-tech people are in awe.

I wrote this article to explain why I will always use the terminal in my tutorials. This is an opinion and you don't have to use the terminal if you don't want to but it might be cool to try it out.
