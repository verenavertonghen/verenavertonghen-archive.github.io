There are a couple of reasons why I like using it
- It makes me feel powerful, I love seeing someone's face going wide eyed because I've typed something and now the screen is vomiting random word. But I also love telling these people that it's actually nothing different then learning a new language. when I'm typing in commands and non-tech people are in awe.
- When we use a GUI for tasks like compiling sass, using Git or any other type you're being dependent on that tool. If that tool breaks down then you have a problem. You can also have a lot of different tools that do the same thing. We are adding a layer that we don't really need.
- I have read an article once where they compare terminals with chatbots and I couldn't agree more with this. In stead of typing a lot of buttons we say in plain text what we want to do. And that is were the next pro comes in.
- In some cases you will have to type in somethings and press an amount of buttons.

So why aren't we all using the terminal?
- When you just start working with it you know nothing, you have to start from scratch and learn step by step how you can talk to your computer.
- Some tasks are a too advanced so it wouldn't make sense to use it for it. But I'm talking about quick wins.

I wrote this article to explain why I will always use the terminal in my tutorials. This is an opinion and you don't have to use the terminal if you don't want to but it might be cool to try it out.
